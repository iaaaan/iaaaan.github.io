  For me, Into the Okavango started as a 3 hour project as OCR's co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt">Jer Thorp</a> asked me to design a basic interface on a map he had developed for National Geographic explorer <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/steve-boyes/">Steve Boyes</a>. As new expeditions with growing budgets were planned in the following years, the platform gained in complexity, features, and diversity of data sources.

  While the original expedition was tracked using a beacon tracking device located on one of the expedition's canoes, the second one allowed us to visualize each team member's geo-location in real time via GPS tracked wristbands. Following each adventurer's heartbeat all along the expedition gives us a glimpse at their mindset as they travel across the delta.

  The third issue of the Okavango expeditions took the adventure to another level, as it turned in a 120 days journey, involved several teams of researchers, and set in motion the creation of a feature-length documentary by National Geographic. The new version of the platform involved the creation of new sections encouraging people to explore large quantities of content posted by explorers on social media, as well as exploring information by themselves via a user-friendly API explorer.

<p>
  As <a href="https://intotheokavango.org">intotheokavango.org</a> matured to become a full-fledged exploration platform, the number of expeditions per year started multiplying, and what was a one-afternoon project had become a major project for our studio.
