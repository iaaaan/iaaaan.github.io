  The alpha release of the extension was a rich experience for us as we learned what people were looking for in a tool like Floodwatch. Furthermore, it enabled us to collect a significant pool of real life ads seen by thousands of people, that would help us extending our research.
</p>

<p>
  To that end, we collaborated with <a href="https://www.rebelmouse.com/quasimondo/">Mario Klingemann</a> who brought machine learning into our data processes in order to classify ads by the types of producs or services they advertise. This sparked a new phase of research as we were getting closer to fulfill the initial intent of Floodwatch: reverse-engineering ad technology by matching ad classification with the demographic information of the people they are served to.

  Based on this new work, the next (beta) version of Floodwatch will focus on enabling people to compre their ad profile with other population groups. Inspired by the original Signature mode we prototyped, it features an entirely new design encouraging people to share more personal demographic information in a controlled and privacy-friendly environment.
