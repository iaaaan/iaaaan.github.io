  In parallel of my work refreshing community data for the main visualization, I started exploring how the tools at our disposal could help us understand the shape of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/20/the-six-types-of-twitter-conversations/" target="_blank">conversations on social media</a>. We were especially interested in uncovering how viral content propagates across the platform.

  To begin this investigation, I started collecting the most viral content that Aurora's backend was catching on a daily basis.  From there, I used Twitter's internal services for building out 'conversation trees' (every reply to a tweet, and their own replies, and so on) from those data points. This was not something easily done with existing APIs, so it took a lot of research on our end in order to get to a satisfying result. Ultimately, by limiting ourselves to 10 degrees of recursion, we were able to catch an average of 99.9% of all conversation trees we looked at (this is due to the large volume of tweets involved in the conversations we were interested in).

<p>
  In order to make sense out of the sheer volume of data collected, I designed and developed a simple web interface that let us review all conversation trees and sort them based on a number of metrics. Already, this allowed us to better understand the many shapes of Twitter conversations. Eventually, the tool also turned turned out to be helpful for curating future visualization content.

  While <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/20/the-six-types-of-twitter-conversations/" target="_blank">Pew's study of Twitter's shapes of conversation</a> focused specifically on overall group interactions, our tool helped us identify a wide range of patterns within single conversations. It also helped us explore other dimensions, like volume and time. Quickly, recurring patterns started to emerge and we were able to identify conversation types.
