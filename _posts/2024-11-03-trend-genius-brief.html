  Over the course of my tenure at Twitter NEXT, I have often produced research for luxury and fashion brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and others. Those research projects gave us great insight into the fashion world online.

  Among many particularities, I was always interested in the importance of brand ambassadors in the fashion conversation. For fashion houses to dress celebrities has been common practice for ever. But in the recent past we've seen it systematized, as Louis Vuitton started recruiting a rolling cast of brand ambassadors, including Zendaya, Bradley Cooper, and Lebron James. At Twitter, we saw how this shift impacted the fashion conversation. Viral moments involving fashion brands rarely focused on product launches anymore: they were instead driven by celebrity fandom, and the advertised products became a secondary center of attention.

  This change in strategy created a challenge for Louis Vuitton in particular. While the brand was able to launch ambassador-driven social media campaigns that were timed with their product launches, they were missing out on the many viral moments that their sponsored celebrities were generating organically on Twitter during the rest of the year. For instance when Zendaya was seen on a red carpet, when Bradley Cooper was seen at a NFL game, or when Lebron James set a new record on the court.

  How could Louis Vuitton capitalize on the excitement that brand ambassadors generate all year long, beyond product launches? I started working on Trend Genius as a way to answer this question.
