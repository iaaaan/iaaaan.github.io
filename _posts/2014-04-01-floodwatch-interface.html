  Based on our initial research, it appeared that we needed to design Floodwatch for enabling people to explore the ads they had been served in an almost entertaining way. Beyond being empowering, this would also incentivize people to take part in the longer-term project of collecting a comprehensive database of online targeting.

<p>
  After a few days of data collection, users are presented with a visually striking wall of ads they have been served online. They can witness the volume and frequency at which certain products have been advertised to them. And this is when the fun begins, as Floodwatch provides them with tools to filter the data collection by many dimensions, as well as sorting them by their frequency, or—more interesting—their singularity.

  Floodwatch's interface draws inspiration from many projects, but I have to give special credit to Moritz Stefaner's <a href="http://selfiecity.net/">Selfie City</a>, which had a strong influence on our work.

  Floodwatch was released on the Chrome store where it gathered a fair amount of press attention as well as the participation of about 10,000 users for a few months.
