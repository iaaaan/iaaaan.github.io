  In conjunction to the research phase going on in New York, I was lucky enough to be sent for a field research trip in Tanzania, South Africa, and Bostswana. It was an opportunity to meet a number of researchers and conservation specialists, whose help and guidance had a critical impact on our research.

  More importantly, it was a chance for me to discover the reality of elephant life and conservation. If visualization sometimes fail at capturing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q6aA5qdCzU">weight of data</a>, this experience in Africa was a mandate for always remembering what was at stake: the life of a keystone species in the African landscape.
