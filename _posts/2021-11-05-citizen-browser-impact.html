	In January 2021, a <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/19/facebook-said-it-would-stop-pushing-users-to-join-partisan-political-groups-it-didnt" target="_blank">Citizen Browser investigation</a> revealed that Facebook failed its promise to stop pushing political groups to its users. This led Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/26/lawmaker-questions-facebook-on-broken-election-related-promise" target="_blank">to demand answers</a> from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company later fixed the issue, which it attributed to "technical issues."

	In March 2021, The Markup used Citizen Browser to demonstrate how <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/03/04/official-information-about-covid-19-is-reaching-fewer-black-people-on-facebook" target="_blank">COVID-19 information was less likely to reach black people</a> than other groups on Facebook. A month later, <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/05/20/facebook-said-it-would-stop-recommending-anti-vaccine-groups-it-didnt" target="_blank">additional data showed</a> that Facebook kept pushing anti-vaccine content to the public.

	In April 2021, Citizen Browser data revealed that <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/04/29/credit-card-ads-were-targeted-by-age-violating-facebooks-anti-discrimination-policy" target="_blank">credit card ads were targeted by age</a>, which violated Facebook’s anti-discrimination policy. In response, the company <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/05/04/facebook-pledges-to-remove-discriminatory-credit-and-loan-ads-discovered-by-the-markup" target="_blank">pledged</a> to remove those ads.
