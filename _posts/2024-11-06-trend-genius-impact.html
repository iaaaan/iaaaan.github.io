      When Bradley Cooper unexpectedly turned up at a Taylor Swift concert in 2023, the conversation exploded on Twitter. Louis Vuitton was ready to seize the moment as Trend Genius launched an activation that targeted Bradley's fans on the platform.

  Trend Genius for Louis Vuitton was a resounding success and a demonstration that online advertising doesn't have to be creepy. In fact, it can get the right audience downright excited: Trend Genius ads saw a link-click rate twice higher than concurrent Louis Vuiton ads on Twitter. Since then, Trend Genius has generated millions of dollars in revenue, and was deployed in behalf of high profile clients including Google, Microsoft, McDonald's, T-Mobile, and many others. It also opened the door to more creative experiments, including the monitoring of in-game plays during sport events, or the launch of customized ads based on weather patterns.
