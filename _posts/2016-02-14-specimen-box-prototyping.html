  The initial phase of the project was as intense as exciting for us, as we gathered a team of coders, statisticians and music composers to look at the data provided to us by Microsoft. In the matter of a couple weeks each team member came up with a number of quick prototypes taking a stab at various aspects of the data: periodicity, language, network dynamics, etc... A first breakthrough came from OCR co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt">Jer Thorp</a>'s contribution: a "portrait" botnet based on its activity over time across all infected IPs.

  These botnet portraits revealed intricate details about the very organic behaviors that describes each botnets. Peer-to-peer networks showed totally different patterns than standard botnets; Waledac—a botnet involved in e-mail spam and a favorite of mine—showed Tron-like patterns.

  Co-worker <a href="http://www.noayounse.com/">Noa Younse</a> took this initial visualization further by developing a number of algorithms for sorting IP activity by other metrics, such as geo-location and behavior similarity. His experiments allowed us to generate new portraits that reflected the deeper mechanics of each botnet and their hierarchies.

  This research helped us defining an overall concept for our work with Microsoft. We now had to define how to interact with it.
