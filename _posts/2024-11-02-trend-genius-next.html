  At Twitter, the Brand Strategy team partners with high profile brands to push the boundaries of social media advertising. Our remit has been to leverage insights and creativity in order to create ads that people can be excited about—a high bar in the online advertising landscape.

  As the sole data scientist on the team, I have been involved in countless advertising campaigns for top brand accounts in the US and abroad. While the scope of my work has mostly focused on audience research, projects like Trend Genius have been an opportunity to contribute directly to the production of campaigns on the platform.
