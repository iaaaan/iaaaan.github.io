  Data visualization can sometimes be a dead-end, as it displays powerful yet finished stories that can hardly be taken further by their audiences. If our platform means to become a centralized entry point for Okavango field data, it has to be an accessible, flexible one. To this end, the 2014 version of the site provides people with a user-friendly API explorer.

 Designed and developed by creative researcher <a href="http://portfolio.genevievehoffman.com/">Genevieve Hoffman</a>, the API explorer provides people with simple tools to question our database. The system takes simple parameters and outputs information in flexible forms, from raw data sets to maps and diagrams that can be reused by everyone.

  Our hope is to develop a platform that will be appropriated by students, journalists, artists and developers. As we see people exploring the information we collected, we find our project living beyond our initial vision.
