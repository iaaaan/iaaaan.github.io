  DEFACE (WIP)

Deface is an app that prevents Facebook from reading people's messages. 

While messaging apps such as Signal and Whatsapp have successfully brought encryption technology to people's private conversations, privacy is still lacking on public feeds themselves. To address this issue, Deface leverages encryption and peer-to-peer technologies in order to protect people's content, facilitate conversations with their friends, and keep algorithms at bay.


CONTEXT

  Facebook's online privacy abuses have been known of the public for more than a decade. Every passing year has brought new chilling revelations of data misuses. Some of the most recent include the ways Facebook [manipulates its news feed for research purposes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/30/facebook-emotion-study-breached-ethical-guidelines-researchers-say), [its racially-biased protections against hate speech](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms), and [cases of redlining in ad targeting](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race). The Cambridge Analytica scandal and subsequent senate hearing in 2018 revealed these abuses were not bugs, but integral features of the platform.

  In a similarly abusive fashion, governments in the United States and many other countries have been ramping up their efforts to collect their citizens' information. Amidst the rise of populism and authoritarianism, legislators and law enforcement agencies have been advocating for [personal data retention](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/member-states-ask-for-new-eu-data-retention-rules/) and [encryption backdoors](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/325880-uk-home-minister-calls-for-encryption-backdoors). Recent examples include FBI chief Christopher Wray [equating unbreakable encryption with an 'urgent public safety issue,'](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/368094-fbi-chief-warns-impenetrable-device-encryption-poses-urgent-public) or ICE calling for tech companies to [develop algorithms that track visa holders on social media](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/361660-ice-asks-tech-companies-to-help-them-track-visa-holders-on-social-media).

  The future looks grim but the threat is also very real at the present time, as major tech companies comply with governments by [turning in large swaths of personal data records](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/technology/facebook-government-regulations.html). Under the false pretense of fighting against [extremism](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/19/theresa-may-will-tell-internet-firms-to-tackle-extremist-content) and [fake news](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/04/575580790/frances-macron-says-he-wants-law-to-combat-fake-news), there has been a historical, nonpartisan effort to undermine the last safeguards against mass surveillance.

  Thankfully, the rising popularity of encrypted messaging applications like Signal means more and more people can communicate securely. It’s however far from sufficient: the most recent news have showed these apps are pressured to [give in user metadata to law enforcement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/01/22/whatsapp-facebook-backdoor-government-data-request/#71b90a8a1030), and are sometimes [entirely censored by authoritarian governments](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841292/iran-telegram-block-encryption-protest-google-signal). Perhaps more importantly, their efforts are inherently limited to private communications. If we are serious about protecting privacy, we need to think about how to cover the full range of people's online presence.

  Given the ever-growing threat posed by corporations and governments to online privacy, how can we appropriate social media feeds to make the internet more secure, decentralized, and open? Deface is the beginning of an answer to this question.

  Deface is a browser extension that prevents Facebook from reading people’s messages.

  While encryption usually happens at the private conversation level, Deface protects content meant to be shared with many friends. It captures messages posted on Facebook, encrypts them, and posts encryption keys to a decentralized database shared by all users. People who have installed the extension can read those messages as they normally would, while others can only see a garbled string of characters. Facebook's algorithms are kept at bay by a captcha system enforced by the community.

  The success of Deface would benefit to the general public in several ways:

    The adversarial approach taken by the project would spark a debate. It would question Facebook's unethical practices, and challenge the established view that there's no possible privacy in online spaces. 

    It would effectively prevent Facebook and third-party organizations from sweeping through millions of messages with their algorithms. This could drastically increase the [cost of mass surveillance](https://vimeo.com/110064108#t=315s). For instance, law enforcement agencies like the ICE would have to track immigrants on a case by case basis instead of monitoring millions of people automatically.

    As an open source tool, Deface would provide a replicable framework for decoupling user-generated content from the online platforms where it is posted. This could pave the way for many other projects of content reappropriation on social media.

  Deface has been in the making for several years and is now reaching a point where I can confidently share it with the world. For a long time I have been reluctant to make this project public before its actual release, but this past year made me realize the necessity to open the process to a wider community in order to tackle the many social, philosophical, legal, and technical challenges ahead of us.

CURRENT CHALLENGES, ROADMAP & OPEN SOURCE (+WORKSHOPS)

  DECENTRALIZED RECAPTCHA

  Today, Deface exists as a working prototype for Google Chrome. The 8-month period that separates us from the start of the 2018-2019 Data & Society fellowship will be used to bring the current alpha version to a beta, semi-public release. Current funds will be allocated to involve decentralized software experts to optimize the peer-to-peer protocol that powers the application. Cryptography experts will help strengthening its encryption mechanisms. The user experience and interface will be refined. Most importantly, I hope to bring Deface to mobile devices and all major browsers.


  However, this will not be enough. Deface raises issues that can only be addressed by rigorous, multidisciplinary research of the sort that is conducted at Data & Society. The following are some of the many social, philosophical, legal, and technical challenges that this project faces. How to prepare against Facebook's countermeasures, and avoid crushing legal repercussions? What strategies can be used to prevent crowdforcing? Is there a risk of obfuscating other types of surveillance that go unaddressed by Deface, such as metadata collection? How to inform the public of the security trade-offs made by the application, and mitigate the risks it poses to populations living in heavily surveilled countries? In order to address these questions and many more, this project will greatly benefit from the multidisciplinary environment offered by Data & Society.
