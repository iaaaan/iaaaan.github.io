  Deface is a work in progress. This page is a comprehensive list of resources for understanding the work produced so far and the road ahead of us. At this stage of the project, we hope to open our process to a wider community of programers, designers, lawyers, ethicists, and funders. The source code will be made public on GitHub in a few days.
