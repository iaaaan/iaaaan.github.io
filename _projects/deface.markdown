title:  "Deface"
subtitle: "Deface is an app that prevents Facebook from reading people's messages."
description: "While messaging apps such as Signal and Whatsapp have successfully brought encryption technology to people's private conversations, privacy is still lacking on public feeds themselves. To address this issue, Deface leverages encryption and peer-to-peer technologies in order to protect people's content, facilitate conversations with their friends, and keep algorithms at bay."
